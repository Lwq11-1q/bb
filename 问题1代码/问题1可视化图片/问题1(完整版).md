#### 问题1：假定各种农作物未来的预期销售量、种植成本、亩产量和销售价格相对于 2023 年保持稳定，每季种植的农作物在当季销售。如果某种作物每季的总产量超过相应的预期销售量，超过部分不能正常销售。请针对以下两种情况，分别给出该乡村 2024~2030 年农作物的最优种植方案，将结果分别填入 result1_1.xlsx 和 result1_2.xlsx 中（模板文件见附件 3）。
* (1) 超过部分滞销，造成浪费；
* (2) 超过部分按 2023 年销售价格的 50%降价出售。

注：	
* (1) 水浇地的第一季通常是在每年的3月至6月前后，第二季是在7月至10月前后。		
* (2) 普通大棚的第一季通常是在每年的5月至9月前后，第二季是在9月至下一年4月前后。		
* (3) 智慧大棚的第一季通常是在每年的3月至7月前后，第二季是在8月至下一年的2月前后。		
注：
* (1) 该数据是2023年根据近几年的相应数据统计所得。								
* (2) 智慧大棚第一季可种植的蔬菜作物及其亩产量、种植成本和销售价格均与普通大棚相同，表中省略。								


#### 假设农民是理性的有预期的种植，产出的产量是和市场需求大致相同。

#### 思路：一共六种地块类型，34个地块，平旱地、梯田和山坡种粮食（一季），水浇地种水稻（一季）或蔬菜（两季），普通大棚种蔬菜和食用菌（各一季），智慧大棚种蔬菜（两季）。
* 不能连续种植，也就是说除了水浇地种蔬菜、普通大棚和智慧大棚外，其他的地块都不能在来年种同样类型的植物。
* 如果水浇地种植蔬菜，第一季只能种大白菜、白萝卜和红萝卜除外的蔬菜（可以合种），第二季只能种大白菜、白萝卜和红萝卜（不可合种）。
* 智慧大棚不能种大白菜、白萝卜和红萝卜。
* 每三年所有土壤都必须种一次豆类，如果2023年的数据该地块每种，则接下来的两年就必须种，如果种植，那么这个时间需要重新计算。
* 作物种植不能太分散
* 每个作物在单个地块种植面积不能太小。
* 需要考虑下滞销问题（但这个属于附加项，直观一点来说，我们简单的将2023年的数据作为未来的销量，然后直接就将这个附加项给处理掉。但另外的，也可以考虑更加复杂的情况，将可能滞销的销量作为一个优化问题的随机扰动项）
##### 现在的问题是：给定销量、成本、产量和销售价格，给出最优种植方案。本质上这是一个优化模型，需要考虑的是，何为最优种植方案。一般来说，这种优化模型就是利润最大化模型，但基于利润最大化优化模型，还可以提出改进模型，比如基于效率的利润最大化优化模型。将效率考虑到优化模型中。

### 数据处理，把附件1、2的不同sheet里的内容融合到一起
#### 需要注意的是，我们只融合那些2023年存在记录（销量）的数据

#### 对于销售单价，我们取平均销售单价作为作物的销售单价

#### 假设农民是理性的有预期的种植，产出的产量总是和市场需求大致相同。


```python
ls = []
for i in result['销售单价/(元/斤)']:
    n = float(i.split('-')[0])
    m = float(i.split('-')[1])
    ls.append((n+m)/2)
result['平均销售单价'] = ls

result['总销量'] = result['亩产量/斤']*result['种植面积/亩']
result['总成本'] = result['平均销售单价']*result['种植面积/亩']
result['总盈利'] = result['总销量']*result['平均销售单价']-result['总成本']

df = result.copy()
```

#### 不同作物的产量情况，根据假设，销量就等于产量


```python
df.groupby('作物名称').sum()['总销量'].plot(kind = "barh",figsize = (8,10), color='#1E90FF') #颜色,matplotlib
plt.xticks(rotation=0)
plt.xlabel("总销量")
plt.ylabel("作物名称")
plt.yticks(fontsize = 12)


plt.show()
```


![png](output_11_0.png)


#### 不同作物的盈利情况


```python
#不同蔬菜品类的数量分布
df.groupby('作物名称').sum()['总盈利'].plot(kind = "barh",figsize = (8,10),color='#FA8072') #颜色,matplotlib
plt.xticks(rotation=0)
plt.xlabel("总盈利")
plt.ylabel("作物名称")
plt.yticks(fontsize = 12)


plt.show()
```


![png](output_13_0.png)


#### 种植面积和亩产量之间的关系，可以看到，大部分的作物不存在这种关系，而非豆类的数据，存在一部分是正向关系，这可能和规模化有关


```python
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.scatterplot(data=df, x='种植面积/亩', y='亩产量/斤', hue='是否豆类', palette='coolwarm', s=100)
plt.title('种植面积与亩产量的关系')
plt.xlabel('种植面积（亩）')
plt.ylabel('亩产量（斤）')
plt.legend(title='是否豆类')

plt.show()
```


![png](output_15_0.png)


#### 不同作物类型的单价分布，可以看到，食用菌的销售价格是最高的，然后粮食的价格也会高于蔬菜


```python
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.boxplot(data=df, x='作物类型', y='平均销售单价', palette='Set3')
plt.title('不同作物类型的销售单价分布')
plt.xlabel('作物类型')
plt.ylabel('销售单价（元/斤）')
plt.ylim(0,80)

plt.show()

```


![png](output_17_0.png)


#### 不同季次作物的种植面积,这也和前面的设定相同，平旱地、梯田和山坡只有単季节的粮食，大棚才能种食用菌


```python
grouped_data = df.groupby(['种植季次', '作物类型'])['种植面积/亩'].sum().unstack()
grouped_data.plot(kind='bar', stacked=True, figsize=(10, 6), colormap='Set2')
plt.title('不同季次作物的种植面积')
plt.xlabel('种植季次')
plt.ylabel('种植面积（亩）')
plt.legend(title='作物类型', bbox_to_anchor=(1.05, 1), loc='upper left')
plt.xticks(rotation=0)

plt.show()

```

#### 为了更清晰的看到种植成本和利润的对比，我们将两个图画在了一起，可以看到只有高盈利的作物，农民才会对其进行加量生成，符合标准的市场规律。


```python
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
ax = df.plot(kind='bar', x='作物名称', y='总成本', figsize=(12, 8), color='skyblue', legend=False)
ax.set_ylabel('种植成本（元/亩）', color='skyblue')
ax.tick_params(axis='x', labelsize=5)  # 调整 x 轴标签字体大小

ax2 = ax.twinx()
df.plot(kind='line', x='作物名称', y='总盈利', ax=ax2, color='red', marker='o', legend=False)
ax2.set_ylabel('利润（元）', color='red')
ax2.tick_params(axis='x', labelsize=0)  # 调整 x 轴标签字体大小

plt.title('种植成本与利润对比')
plt.xlabel('作物名称')


plt.show()

```


    <Figure size 1000x600 with 0 Axes>



![png](output_21_1.png)


#### 不同作物类型的总利润与平均利润


```python
# 计算每种作物类型的总利润（利润合计）和平均利润
profit_by_crop_type = df.groupby('作物类型').agg(
    总盈利=('总盈利', 'sum'),
    平均利润=('总盈利', 'mean')
).reset_index()

# 创建双轴图，展示总利润和平均利润
fig, ax1 = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 6))

# 总利润柱状图
sns.barplot(data=profit_by_crop_type, x='作物类型', y='总盈利', ax=ax1, color='skyblue')
ax1.set_ylabel('总利润（元）', color='skyblue')
ax1.tick_params(axis='y', labelcolor='skyblue')
ax1.set_xlabel('作物类型')
ax1.set_ylim(0, profit_by_crop_type['总盈利'].max() * 1.2)

# 平均利润折线图
ax2 = ax1.twinx()
sns.lineplot(data=profit_by_crop_type, x='作物类型', y='平均利润', ax=ax2, color='red', marker='o')
ax2.set_ylabel('平均利润（元）', color='red')
ax2.tick_params(axis='y', labelcolor='red')
ax2.set_ylim(0, profit_by_crop_type['平均利润'].max() * 1.2)

plt.title('不同作物类型的总利润与平均利润')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)

plt.show()

```

### 优化模型



### 1. **决策变量**：
定义决策变量 $x_{i,j,t}$，其中：
- $i \in \{1, \dots, N\}$：表示第 $i$ 块地。
- $j \in \{1, \dots, M\}$：表示第 $j$ 种作物。
- $t \in \{1, 2\}$：表示季节，$t=1$ 为第一季，$t=2$ 为第二季。

$x_{i,j,t}$ 是一个二进制变量：
$$
x_{i,j,t} = 
\begin{cases} 
1 & \text{如果地块 } i \text{ 在第 } t \text{ 季种植作物 } j, \\
0 & \text{否则}.
\end{cases}
$$

### 2. **目标函数：利润最大化**：
最大化总利润：
$$
\text{Maximize } Z = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{j=1}^{M} \sum_{t=1}^{2} \left( p_j \cdot r_j \cdot A_i \cdot x_{i,j,t} - c_{i,j} \cdot A_i \cdot x_{i,j,t} \right)
$$
其中：
- $p_j$ 是作物 $j$ 的单价。
- $r_j$ 是作物 $j$ 的单位面积产量。
- $c_{i,j}$ 是在地块 $i$ 种植作物 $j$ 的单位成本。
- $A_i$ 是地块 $i$ 的面积。

### 3. **约束条件**：

#### 3.1 地块类型约束：
根据不同类型的地块，施加不同的种植约束。

1. **平旱地、梯田、山坡只能种一季粮食作物**：
对这些地块类型 $T_i \in \{\text{平旱地, 梯田, 山坡}\}$，只能种一季粮食：
$$
\sum_{j \in S_{\text{grain}}} x_{i,j,1} = 1 \quad \forall i \text{ such that } T_i \in \{\text{平旱地, 梯田, 山坡}\}
$$
且不能种第二季：
$$
\sum_{j=1}^{M} x_{i,j,2} = 0 \quad \forall i \text{ such that } T_i \in \{\text{平旱地, 梯田, 山坡}\}
$$

2. **水浇地只能种一季水稻或两季蔬菜**：
对于水浇地 $T_i = \text{水浇地}$，可以种一季水稻或两季蔬菜：
$$
\sum_{j \in S_{\text{rice}}} x_{i,j,1} + \sum_{j \in S_{\text{vegetable1}}} x_{i,j,1} = 1 \quad \forall i \text{ such that } T_i = \text{水浇地}
$$
且第二季只能种特定蔬菜：
$$
\sum_{j \in S_{\text{vegetable2}}} x_{i,j,2} \leq 1 \quad \forall i \text{ such that } T_i = \text{水浇地}
$$

3. **普通大棚必须种一季蔬菜和一季食用菌**：
对于普通大棚 $T_i = \text{普通大棚}$，必须种一季蔬菜和一季食用菌：
$$
\sum_{j \in S_{\text{vegetable}}} x_{i,j,1} = 1 \quad \forall i \text{ such that } T_i = \text{普通大棚}
$$
$$
\sum_{j \in S_{\text{fungi}}} x_{i,j,2} = 1 \quad \forall i \text{ such that } T_i = \text{普通大棚}
$$

4. **智慧大棚必须种两季蔬菜**：
对于智慧大棚 $T_i = \text{智慧大棚}$，每年必须种两季蔬菜：
$$
\sum_{j \in S_{\text{vegetable}}} x_{i,j,1} = 1 \quad \forall i \text{ such that } T_i = \text{智慧大棚}
$$
$$
\sum_{j \in S_{\text{vegetable}}} x_{i,j,2} = 1 \quad \forall i \text{ such that } T_i = \text{智慧大棚}
$$

#### 3.2 豆类轮作约束：
每块地至少每三年种一次豆类作物。假设豆类作物集合为 $S_{\text{bean}}$：
$$
\sum_{j \in S_{\text{bean}}} \left( x_{i,j,1} + x_{i,j,2} \right) \geq 1 \quad \forall i
$$

#### 3.3 作物不分散约束（种植面积限制）：
每种作物 $j$ 的种植总面积不能小于最小阈值 $A_{\text{min},j}$：
$$
\sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{t=1}^{2} A_i \cdot x_{i,j,t} \geq A_{\text{min},j} \quad \forall j
$$

#### 3.4 非负和二进制变量约束：
决策变量 $x_{i,j,t}$ 为二进制变量，表示是否种植作物：
$$
x_{i,j,t} \in \{0, 1\} \quad \forall i, \forall j, \forall t
$$

### 完整的数学模型总结：

目标函数：
$$
\text{Maximize } Z = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{j=1}^{M} \sum_{t=1}^{2} \left( p_j \cdot r_j \cdot A_i \cdot x_{i,j,t} - c_{i,j} \cdot A_i \cdot x_{i,j,t} \right)
$$

约束条件：
1. **平旱地、梯田、山坡种植限制**：
$$
\sum_{j \in S_{\text{grain}}} x_{i,j,1} = 1 \quad \forall i \text{ such that } T_i \in \{\text{平旱地, 梯田, 山坡}\}
$$
$$
\sum_{j=1}^{M} x_{i,j,2} = 0 \quad \forall i \text{ such that } T_i \in \{\text{平旱地, 梯田, 山坡}\}
$$

2. **水浇地种植限制**：
$$
\sum_{j \in S_{\text{rice}}} x_{i,j,1} + \sum_{j \in S_{\text{vegetable1}}} x_{i,j,1} = 1
$$
$$
\sum_{j \in S_{\text{vegetable2}}} x_{i,j,2} \leq 1
$$

3. **普通大棚种植限制**：
$$
\sum_{j \in S_{\text{vegetable}}} x_{i,j,1} = 1
$$
$$
\sum_{j \in S_{\text{fungi}}} x_{i,j,2} = 1
$$

4. **智慧大棚种植限制**：
$$
\sum_{j \in S_{\text{vegetable}}} x_{i,j,1} = 1
$$
$$
\sum_{j \in S_{\text{vegetable}}} x_{i,j,2} = 1
$$

5. **豆类轮作约束**：
$$
\sum_{j \in S_{\text{bean}}} \left( x_{i,j,1} + x_{i,j,2} \right) \geq 1
$$

6. **种植面积限制**：
$$
\sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{t=1}^{2} A_i \cdot x_{i,j,t} \geq A_{\text{min},j}
$$

7. **二进制约束**：
$$
x_{i,j,t} \in \{0, 1\} \quad \forall i, \forall j, \forall t
$$

#### 假设每个作物的销售量会在上下10%的范围内浮动，我们的策略是根据去年销量的最大上涨范围作为目标销量，秉持宁可浪费，也不无法满足百姓食品需求的原则，制作生产计划，然后在目标函数中，使用最大下降范围作为真实的销量，将其放入到目标函数中，就可以得到剩余部分造成的损失，因此就存在两个模型，一个是“超过部分滞销，直接浪费“，另一个是“以百分之五十的价格低价出售”

#### 对于未来n年，我们只需要优化最近三年的内容，只要保证每三年，每个土地都种植豆类，那么即可保证土地是营养的，并且最终的目标模型以利润最大化目标进行度量，所以未来n年，我们只需要重复的依次填写优化结果即可
